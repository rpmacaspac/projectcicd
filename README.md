Project cicd will test jenkins pipeline that will create workloads for our simple application. Simple "hello world" program written in Python will be deployed in a container once it pass the test and security checks.

Tools used:
*Virtual box that will host our mini cluster(1 master, 2 nodes)
*Vagrant setup for Kubernetes Cluster in VirtualBox
*WSL2 for creating container and managing kubernetes cluster
*Rancher for managing cluster through UI
*Harbor for storing docker images
*Sonarqube running in cluster to check code smelss
*Trivy running in cluster to check docker images security and vulnerability checks
*Jenkins running on default namespace wsl2(docker desktop integrated)
